## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Typescale](https://typescale.com/) - usefull tool for typography sizes system
- [TintsAndShadesGenerator](https://maketintsandshades.com) - usefull tool for generating tints and shades for button hoover effect

### What I learned

- images have some space at the bottom because this is how inline elements behave. They need some reserved space at the bottom for the "descenders" we find on letters. (example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804256/image-inside-div-has-extra-space-below-the-image))
- a neat trick for changing images based on viewport size is to use html "picture" tag
